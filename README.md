# My Data Science & Machine Learning Portfolio

Hi there! 👋 Welcome to my portfolio. This is a curated collection of my projects, demonstrating a range of skills from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to supervised and unsupervised machine learning.

---

## 1. Data Analysis (EDA)

* **[911 Calls EDA Capstone Project](https://github.com/agrim-git-hub/911-Calls-EDA-Capstone)**
    > A capstone project performing in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on 911 call data to uncover trends in call volume, reasons, and locations.

---

## 2. Supervised Learning (Regression & Classification)

* **[Linear Regression: E-commerce Customer Spending](https://github.com/agrim-git-hub/Linear-Regression-Ecommerce-Customers)**
    > Using Linear Regression to predict the "Yearly Amount Spent" by e-commerce customers based on their app/website usage and membership length.

* **[Logistic Regression: Titanic Survival Prediction](https://github.com/agrim-git-hub/Logistic-Regression-Titanic-Survival)**
    > Using Logistic Regression to predict passenger survival on the Titanic based on features like age, class, and gender.

* **[K-Nearest Neighbors Project](https://github.com/agrim-git-hub/K-Nearest-Neighbors-Project)**
    > Applying the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to a classified dataset to predict a target class, including a step to find the optimal 'K' value.

* **[Decision Trees & Random Forest: Loan Prediction](https://github.com/agrim-git-hub/Decision-Forest-Loan-Prediction)**
    > Predicting whether a borrower will pay back their loan in full, comparing the performance of Decision Trees and Random Forest models.

* **[Support Vector Machines: Iris Flower Classification](https://github.com/agrim-git-hub/SVM-Iris-Flower-Classification)**
    > Using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and GridSearch to build a model capable of classifying different species of Iris flowers.

## 3. Unsupervised Learning

* **[K-Means Clustering: University Grouping](https://github.com/agrim-git-hub/K-Means-Clustering-Universities)**
    > An unsupervised learning project using K-Means Clustering to group universities into 'Private' and 'Public' categories based on their features.

* **[Principal Component Analysis: Breast Cancer Analysis](https://github.com/agrim-git-hub/PCA-Breast-Cancer-Analysis)**
    > Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the breast cancer dataset for visualization and analysis.

---

## 4. Recommender Systems

* **[Movie Recommender System](https://github.com/agrim-git-hub/Movie-Recommender-System)**
    > Building an item-based collaborative filtering recommender system to suggest movies based on user ratings.
